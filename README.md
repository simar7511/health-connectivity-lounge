# Health Connectivity Platform: Safe Haven Virtual Pediatric Clinic

A comprehensive platform designed to connect healthcare providers with underserved communities in rural Washington, with a focus on pediatric care for children and adolescents.

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Scaling Rural Healthcare with AI and LLMs initiative at University of Washington. The goal is to develop a virtual pediatric healthcare clinic leveraging AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve access to medical services for children and adolescents in rural Washington, particularly in Adams County. 

By integrating AI-driven intake systems, bilingual virtual consultations, and community-based outreach, the Safe Haven Virtual Pediatric Clinic aims to bridge healthcare gaps for low-income, uninsured, and Hispanic migrant families while enhancing patient engagement and accessibility.
