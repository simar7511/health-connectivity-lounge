This project is part of the Scaling Rural Healthcare with AI and LLMs initiative at University of Washington. The goal is to develop a virtual pediatric healthcare clinic leveraging AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve access to medical services for children and adolescents in rural Washington, particularly in Adams County.

## Target Audience
Marginalized groups, including those who are undocumented, uninsured, and have limited English proficiency, face significant barriers to accessing healthcare. This platform aims to address these challenges.

## Clinic Onboarding
Partner with free clinics in Adams County. Make sure the clinics install the equipment below:
- Laptops, computers, or tablets
- High-speed internet access with secure VPN encryption for patient privacy

To ensure successful implementation, we will provide training for staff and volunteers at partner locations. The training includes:
- How to use our virtual clinic
- Ensuring patient confidentiality and secure data handling

We provide a 24/7 technical helpline for troubleshooting

## Patient Onboarding
Patient Awareness Campaignsï¼š
- Bilingual (Spanish & English) flyers, including a QR code linked to our virtual clinic, at churches, schools, and grocery stores
- Engaging Latino communities through digital platforms, such as WhatsApp

Collaborates with churches and schools, where patients feel safe and supported. Supplying devices, such as tablets, at these locations to ensure patients without personal devices can access our virtual clinic.

Once patients successfully access our virtual clinic, they can schedule an appointment or use the AI chatbot for basic inquiries.
